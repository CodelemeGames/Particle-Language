**File Types**

The ways by which you use the file types are very opinionated for their alternate functionality. Both types are designed for upholding clean programming practises, which is defined below, though things such as what file type you want to use for data will be far more based on your intuition; even with this goal of organisation - this is due to the varying views per-person by which we evaluate worth. We hope that this documentation can help with your understanding if you need it.

**.particle** - standard particle language file, used for defining logic such as functions and program entry points.

**.ph** - particle header file, used for creating objects and types, such as classes or structs, though without the defining 'body' for the logic - which would usually be implemented in a .particle file; though if needed can be done in the same .ph file if you don't think definitions need another file.
