# Particle-Language
A memory-aware hyperset programming language which transpiled down to safe C and C++ code. Essentually, shorter syntax and a new design philosopy - influenced by great languages such as Rust; though a bit lighter.

**Why Particle?**
Languages such as Rust, C# and Python are known for their memory safe nature - either by leveraging a garbage collector or borrow checker. This is great for ensuring no memory issues arise at runtime; though with one caveat, performance. Rust is designed with speed in mind, and it achieves code performance out of the box which is something to be impressed by - though it still needs to have runtime checks to ensure that your program runs as flawless as possible - which leaves it's true potential of code that may surpass the likes of C++ or in some regard, C. Thats where Particle comes in, to allow for code to be written that leverages the speed of mature compilers with languages known for their blazingly fast code - though with little memory safeguards; leaving the floodgates open for a wide variety of CVEs and crashes.
